* **About:** Highly motivated, driven, and completely self-taught engineer with 23+ years experience as a full stack software dev and over 18 years of Platform / Infrastructure engineering and IT automation. Interested in growth opportunities related to low level linux, networking, embedded development and optimizations empowered by FPGA and programmable hardware.   
* **Why you may want me on your team:** I have an insatiable drive to solve complex challenges and explore learning. My greatest strength is not my current knowledge, but an ability to quickly grasp new concepts and bring order and efficiency out of chaos.   
* **Why I may not be your guy:** Every strength is also a weakness in the wrong situation.  I come alive when allowed to automate repetitive tasks and thrive in continually evolving environments of frequent change. The flip side is without problems to solve and challenges to overcome, I tend to struggle with what value I bring to a company or team.

| *RSVP & ACT, Inc* SRE, SysAdmin, and Platforms Engineer  | April 2019 - June 2021 |
| :---- | ----: |

* Directly responsible for identifying capacity and efficiency constraints, as well as engineering secure, highly-available, horizontally scalable platforms to run production environment apps, services, databases, and infrastructure.   
* Responsible for managing, supporting, and performance-tuning our +3.5TB postgresql database cluster, as well as numerous MySql and SQLite databases. This includes platform configuration tuning, as well as identifying performance and scaling issues caused by poorly structured queries and application-level inefficiencies and working with the development team to resolve these bottlenecks.   
* Architected, deployed, and managed dynamically scaling, secure, and fully version-controlled hybrid and bare-metal kubernetes clusters. Primarily responsible for all migrations from legacy systems to kubernetes.  Notable tools: native cgroupsv2-based container tools (crio-o, containerd, podman, etc), kubeadm, ansible, terraform, cloudflare, haproxy, nginx, metallb, cloud-config, ipxe, minio.io, and various rancher services (eventually decommissioned).  
* Deployed and managed a self-hosted gitlab instance with DevOps build pipelines and automatic blue-green deployments to kubernetes as well as some legacy infrastructure.  Notable tools: haproxy, nginx, traefik, trivy, helm, kubevela, and misc custom scripts in makefiles / bash.   
* Implemented monitoring, alerting, logging, tracing, and observability tools (grafana+loki, jaeger, ELK, netdata, and zabbix)  
* Implemented and enforced gitlab-based Infrastructure-as-Code procedures and pipelines, using various different configuration management tools including Terraform, Packer, Ansible, and iPXE / cloud-config scripts. Also implemented and maintained ArchLinux and Debian package repos in a few cases where it made sense.  
* Deployed and managed multiple host, network, and container security tools and  vulnerability scanners, including wazuh, openvas / nessus, trivy, vuls.io, wireguard, teleport, as well as a private certificate-authority and misc PKI tools.  
* Directly responsible for and fully owned the management, maintenance, and support of all internal and external IT infrastructure, including all servers, networking, VPNs, and workstations.   
* Simplified and standardized our various independent hypervisors with a centralized Proxmox cluster on ZFS and a 56G InfiniBand FC SAN.   
* Deployed a W2019 AD server environment to centralize the user accounts and management of our 50+ workstations, 10+ Window-based servers, and 3 separate shared remote desktop servers.   
* Managed all internal tech support responsibilities for the first year in order to maintain a short feedback loop while re-architecting the entire IT infrastructure.  
* Implemented organization-wide VPN (using Wireguard), VLANS, and several other measures to secure and lock down a multitude of risks and vulnerabilities to both our internal and external environments.   
* Provided training to existing staff to address the knowledge-gaps that caused vulnerabilities, as well as mitigated two ransomware hacks within the first month of employment.  
* Implemented customized Windows PE & Linux based iPXE / network boot servers to streamline provisioning VMs and workstations.
