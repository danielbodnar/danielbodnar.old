## ü§î How I Think & Work

My problem-solving approach is defined by a drive to understand systems at their core (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe/INTP). This allows me to build comprehensive mental models of technology, see non-obvious connections, and generate creative, efficient solutions.

- **What I Bring to Teams:** Rapidly understanding complex systems, spotting potential problems early, and optimizing systems in real-time.
- **What I Need from Teams:** Freedom to innovate, structure around execution, and an appreciation for strategic optimizations.
- **Ideal Environment:** R&D, Systems Architecture, and complex problem-solving roles where I can tackle intellectual challenges with minimal bureaucracy.
