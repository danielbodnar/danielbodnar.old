# Daniel Bodnar's Professional Portfolio

## SRE / Infrastructure Engineer / Solutions Architect / Linux Evangelist

[About Me](about.md) | [Experience](experience.md) | [Skills](skills.md) | [Projects](projects.md) | [Contact](contact.md)

Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm a highly motivated, self-taught engineer with over 23 years of experience in full-stack software development and 18+ years in Platform/Infrastructure engineering and IT automation.

## About Me: Leveraging Cognitive Strengths for Technological Innovation

As a self-taught expert in the IT sector, I bring to the table a unique combination of extensive hands-on experience and an innate ability for abstract thinking. My professional journey, spanning over two decades, is defined not just by the accumulation of technical skills, but by the development of a powerful mental framework that allows me to dissect, analyze, and solve complex technological challenges with exceptional efficiency.

## Problem-Solving Approach

The foundation of my problem-solving approach is built on a specific cognitive structure (often referred to as Ti-Ne-Si-Fe in personality theory). This cognitive stack enables me to excel in several key areas:

1. **Analytical Thinking**: My primary cognitive function drives me to understand the core principles and logical structures of systems. This allows me to build comprehensive mental models of technological ecosystems, facilitating deep understanding and effective problem-solving.

   *Example: At [BitBuilder Cloud](experience.md#bitbuilder-cloud-llc), I single-handedly built core services on custom bare metal servers, demonstrating my ability to understand and implement complex systems.*

2. **Innovative Ideation**: Complementing my analytical skills is a strong ability to generate multiple possibilities and identify non-obvious connections between different concepts. This combination of analytical depth and creative breadth is crucial for developing innovative solutions in complex technological environments.

   *Example: At [RSVP & ACT, Inc](experience.md#rsvp--act-inc), I architected and deployed dynamically scaling, secure, and fully version-controlled hybrid and bare-metal kubernetes clusters, showcasing my innovative approach to infrastructure management.*

3. **Information Processing**: Similar to advanced AI systems, I have the ability to quickly absorb and process large amounts of information. This data is then organized into a well-structured internal knowledge base, which I can efficiently access and utilize when faced with new challenges.

   *Example: Throughout my career, I've consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies, as evidenced by my [diverse skill set](skills.md).*

4. **Adaptive Problem-Solving**: My approach to problem-solving goes beyond applying pre-existing solutions. I excel at synthesizing new approaches by recombining and extrapolating from known principles, allowing me to adapt quickly to new technological paradigms and methodologies.

   *Example: At [AT&T Corp](experience.md#att-corp), I led a team-wide migration from a rails/mysql stack to node.js, angular.js, and mongodb, demonstrating my ability to adapt to and implement new technologies.*
