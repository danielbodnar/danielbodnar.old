# Daniel Bodnar

## SRE / Infrastructure Engineer / Solutions Architect / Linux Evangelist

Highly motivated, driven, and completely self-taught engineer with 27+ years experience as a full-stack software developer (since 1996) and over 18 years of Platform/Infrastructure engineering and IT automation. Interested in growth opportunities related to low-level Linux, networking, embedded development, and optimizations empowered by FPGA and programmable hardware.

## üíª Technology Philosophy & Stack Preferences

I approach technology through the lens of the Unix Philosophy and the principles outlined in "The Art of Unix Programming." My technical decisions are guided by a deep understanding of what problems each technology was designed to solve, its inherent trade-offs, and its appropriate use cases.

### Technology Strengths

- **Linux Ecosystem**: Passionate advocate for Linux, shell scripting, containerization, and kernel-level optimizations with extensive experience in SRE, platform engineering, and network engineering
- **Early Innovation Adopter**: Consistently identify game-changing technologies early in their lifecycle (discovered Docker months after public beta, adopted AngularJS in beta)
- **Full-Stack Versatility**: Building web applications since 1996, with experience spanning multiple technology generations and paradigm shifts
- **Technology Evaluation**: Exceptional ability to assess technologies based on their core design principles and predict their long-term viability and appropriate use cases
- **Architecture Vision**: Combining high-level architectural understanding with low-level technical expertise to create robust, scalable systems

### Preferred Technologies

- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu Server, Arch), FreeBSD
- **Containerization/Orchestration**: Docker, Linux containers, Kubernetes, Buildroot, WolfiOS, DevContainers, LocalStack
- **Languages**: Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash/Shell
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Vue.js (with Nuxt.js), Svelte, SolidJS, Alpine.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Rust
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, DuckDB
- **Networking**: WireGuard, ZeroTier, Tailscale, OpenVPN
- **API Development**: OpenAPI, JSON Schema
- **Configuration Languages**: Cue, Dhall, YAML (when necessary)

### Technologies I Avoid

- **Frameworks**: React (too opinionated and complex), modern Angular (overly complicated)
- **Languages**: PHP (for new projects), Java (for lightweight applications)
- **Architectures**: Monolithic applications where microservices would be more appropriate
- **Tooling**: Overly complex solutions when simpler alternatives would suffice

My strongest differentiator is the ability to see both the forest and the trees simultaneously‚Äîunderstanding the big picture of system architecture while maintaining deep subject matter expertise in low-level implementation details. This enables me to select the right tool for each specific job while avoiding common pitfalls that emerge from mismatched technology choices.

## üåü Team Dynamics & Working Style

My greatest strength lies in rapidly understanding complex systems and envisioning comprehensive solutions, including detailed implementation paths. However, my energy and effectiveness diminish when forced to lock into a single predetermined path and methodically execute it without room for continued exploration and optimization.

**What I Bring to Teams:**
- Quickly understanding complex systems and mapping out comprehensive solution paths
- Spotting potential problems and opportunities during execution, preventing issues before they arise
- Optimizing systems and processes in real-time, finding more efficient paths to desired outcomes
- Providing clear insights into how different approaches might play out in practice
- Adding particular value in situations requiring rapid adaptation and problem-solving

**What I Need from Teams:**
- Freedom to contribute insights and improvements throughout the implementation process
- Structure around execution while still leaving room for strategic adjustments and optimizations
- Understanding that my "distractions" with new possibilities often lead to valuable insights
- Dedicated channels for capturing and evaluating new ideas without derailing current execution
- Teammates who excel at maintaining steady progress while being open to incorporating improvements

**Ideal Environment:**
- Research & Development
- Systems Architecture
- Software Engineering
- Strategy Consulting
- Complex Problem-Solving Roles
- Technology Innovation

**Management Preferences:**
- Intellectually competent leadership
- Complex challenges
- Respect for analytical approach
- Theoretical freedom
- Minimal emotional manipulation
- Logic valued over hierarchy
